<p class="MsoNormal">Objectivity/DB is an Object Database Management System (ODBMS). 
What does this mean? First it is a database management system (DBMS). Like many 
other database management systems it provides for concurrent access in a 
controlled manner to a variety of data. It provides concurrency management, 
transaction management and recovery management. Secondly it is a database 
management system that stores objects. Object Oriented programming became 
popular in the 1980’s with the advent of C++. There were other OO languages 
before this, and others followed. An ODBMS stores the objects in the database as 
the language sees them, not in some database dependent form. In addition 
Objectivity/DB provides features that support transparent distribution of 
objects and processes, and support for very large databases (VLDB).</p>
