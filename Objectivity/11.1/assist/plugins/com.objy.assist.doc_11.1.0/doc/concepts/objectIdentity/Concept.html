<p><b><font size="5">Object Identity</font></b></p>
<p>Every Objectivity/DB object has an identifier that uniquely 
distinguishes it among other objects in the federation. The identifier for an 
object is called its object identifier or OID. An object identifier corresponds 
to the exact storage location of the object within the federated database; it is 
unique within the entire federated database. An object’s OID can change during 
the lifetime of the object only if the object is moved. After an object is moved 
or deleted its previous object identifier is reused for any new object that is 
created in the former location of the moved or deleted object. The identifier of 
a database or container can be expressed in the object identifier format, so 
object identifiers provide a general mechanism for uniquely identifying any 
object in the federated database.</p>
<p>Objectivity/DB uses object identifiers instead of memory 
addresses to identify objects, because they provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent access at runtime to objects located 
  anywhere in the network </li>
  <li>Full interoperability across all platforms </li>
  <li>Access to more objects than a direct memory address permits </li>
  <li>Integrity constraints and runtime type checking that are 
  not possible through direct memory addresses </li>
</ul>
<p>The OID is a 64-bit value broken down in to 4 16 bit 
integers. The 1<sup>st</sup> 16 bits represent the database id, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
16 bits represent the container id, the 3<sup>rd</sup> 16 bits represent the 
logical page number and the last 16 bits represent the logical slot number 
within a page.</p>
